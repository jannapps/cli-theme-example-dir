# CLI Themeing Example Directory

This repository provides a simple way to see all of the possible colors that a terminal emulator may use to display the names of files, directories, and links. This makes it easy to create or modify color schemes to fit your needs.

View your command prompt's coloring as well as the possible coloring for the contents of directories all in one place!

The functionality may be limited by what GitHub "remembers" about things in a repository. If that ends up being the case, I'll provide a script to restore permissions, broken links, etc. Whatever else doesn't work.

## Setup

To create everything that GitHub can't track correctly, run this script:
```
./executable-script.sh
```
